# Localize using arb_translate

In this project, the `arb_translate` package, which is a package used to manage the language files of an application developed with Flutter, was used. You can easily manage the language files of the application and translate the application in different languages.

[You can access the article I wrote about using the package here](https://medium.com/@enesakbal00/flutter-gemini-localize-using-arb-translate-24e5f6736a89).



### Set Up
- Clone Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/enesakbal/arb_translate_example.git
```

- Sign up [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev) and don't forget to replace the ```arb-translate-api-key``` value in the `l10n.yaml` file with your own.

- ```flutter pub get && flutter run```
- ```flutter gen-l10n ``` (if app_localizations.dart file is not generated, run command)
- ```dart run arb_translate``` (if you want to generate arb files, run the command.)
